# MarkerPose
A method for 6D pose estimation based on a 2D marker
# Requirement
+ opencv3.4.5
+ intel realsense2 SDK
+ Eigen
# Some tips
I share full content of my project, so it might seem a little confused.
The core files include **Marker.hpp** and **marker0304.cpp**.
You need make some configuration for opencv, Eigen and realsense2 SDK to run it.
Oh a realsense camera is required, of course you could use another but some codes need to be modifeid.
I will share my paper as soon as it is published.
Good luck and I would be happy if you give me a star.
